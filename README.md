a little exploration of a simpler stack for building web apps

- frontend (vite spa mode + pages)
- api (vinxi)
- database (sqlite + dbmate)
- durable workflows (inngest)
- auth (auth.js)
- tests (vitest)
- reactive frontend db subscriptions (soul)

For development:
```
npm run dev
```

To deploy to production:
